## Project: Just do it already

1. Init app, get it running
2. Split page into 50% using CSS Grid, bc fancy
3. Put CodeMirror onto page with Elm

* The Problem. I need to apply the instance of CodeMirror to the div with id "CodeEditor"
* After Importing CodeMirror, Embedding the Elm app on the root id tag
* my "CodeEditor" element is nowhere to be found.

* Ports
* Ellie as a template

4. Capture coding input and output
5. Evaluate that JS, safely?
6.

    * provides full type inference, and
    * has first-class support for data-race-free concurrency.
