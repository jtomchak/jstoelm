Recovering from our project last week was, to put it kindly, rough. It was a real blow to my self confidence. To be fair, my ambition was on the scale of ridiculous, but I didn't think that I would be utterly and completely shellacked. The feeling I had was complete failure and disappointment. So now what?

  ## Where to go from here ?

So, after getting the show out, I did not even look in the general direction of JS to Elm for the rest of the week, which is pretty unusual. For the most part, I chip away at it over the course of the week, read, shore up the notes, record, let that simmer for a day or so, edit it, and often have a spare day before it's release. Not this week. Nope. For a couple reasons:

1. I did not want to admit that the start to my super duper awesome project, had suffered a major set back before ever getting off the ground.
2. I would have to face the glaring fact, that I have not retained, learned, absorbed, or internalized nearly as much as I thought about Elm, Types, and functional programming in general.
3. With points 1 and 2, where do I go from here?

### Rediscovered Empathy for beginners

### Retooling my own learning

Onward and upward as the saying goes.

### Regaining confidence

* Let's pick a project that we are familiar with, **NO NOT todo MVC**

  ![inline](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*g6c8GzN-fkt4wi1liJGdhA.jpeg)
  [todoMVC](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d)

* Mash together bits of Meowdium and Notes app

  * AWS backend Lamda Functions
  * Serverless deploy
  * DynamoDB
  * Coginto for Auth
  * S3 for image attachments
  * 100% PWA

* Then, once it's done, the real fun begins....
