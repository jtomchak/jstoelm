Taking a look at webassembly. A new compilation that brings more than just
JavaScript to the web,allowing memory managed apps like, C/C++ and Rust to be
compiled down to assembly and run in the browser environment. This along side
your current JavaScript code.

## Webassembly Overview

* Disclaimer: webassembly does not currently support 'Garbage Collected'(GC)
  compilations. This means it's not yet viable for Elm. It will be, however,
  important to web development ecosystem as a whole, and thus very much worth
  our time and energy understanding it, and being ready to leverage it as soon
  as possible.

### What is webassembly?

* wasm is a new portable, size- and load-time-efficient format suitable for
  compilation to the web.
* Efficient and fast
* Open and debuggable (pretty print)
* Part of the open web platform
* webassembly must currently be loaded and compiled by JavaScript.
* General Purpose virtual architecture
* Webassembly is **NOT** always faster than JavaScript
* Pace...

### Inter opt with JavaScript

* For basic loading, there are

  * [three steps](http://webassembly.org/getting-started/js-api/):

  1. Get the .wasm bytes into a typed array or ArrayBuffer
  2. Compile the bytes into a WebAssembly.Module
  3. Instantiate the WebAssembly.Module with imports to get the callable exports

### Linear Memory

* rather than js objects that will be GC (garbage collected later on)
* used to represent the entire heap of a compiled C/C++ application.
* can be considered to be an untyped array of bytes
* it's sandboxed
* execution engineâ€™s internal data structures, the execution stack, local
  variables, or other process memory.
* In the MVP, linear memory cannot be shared between threads of execution. The
  addition of threads :unicorn: will allow this.
* Memories can be created from JavaScript by supplying their initial size and,
  optionally, their maximum size: `var memory = new
  WebAssembly.Memory({initial:10, maximum:100});`
* Memory imports work just like function imports, only Memory objects are passed
  as values instead of JS functions. Memory imports are useful for two reasons:
  1. They allow JavaScript to fetch and create the initial contents of memory
     before or concurrent with module compilation.
  2. They allow a single Memory object to be imported by multiple instances,
     which is a critical building block for implementing **dynamic linking** in
     WebAssembly.

### Getting some wasm in the browser

* [Following Get Started with Rust, WebAssembly, and Webpack](https://github.com/jtomchak/fsociety)
* Installing Node, Rust, updating rustup

```
cd ~
 wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/mozilla-games/emscripten/releases/emsdk-portable.tar.gz
 tar -xvf emsdk-portable.tar.gz
 cd emsdk-portable
 ./emsdk update
 ./emsdk install sdk-incoming-64bit
```

```
cargo new fsociety --bin --vcs none
cd fsociety
npm init -y
```

* Yep, it took a while.

### Gotcha's

* WebAssembly supports integers and floats, coming in 32- and 64-bit varieties.
* translate JavaScript objects to/from their C/C++ equivalents will need a far
  bit of logic
  * think distinct modules
* access to the WASM instance memory via JS ArrayBuffer. access from both sides
  of the fence
* you don't get access to system allocation commands like 'malloc' and 'free,'
* wasm is not always faster than js. there is no silver bullet
