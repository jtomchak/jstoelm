Elm Conf was a little more than a month ago. I didn't get a chance to go, as I
had already spent my conference capital, but Elm Europe is in July, and who
knows? I wanted to discuss a few of the talks I found interesting, and share my
thoughts.

## Elm Conf

### Elm Conf 2017 Closing Q&A

* NoRedInk -
  * Hired Evan. 2ish years ago. Plans for Evan to live for years working only on
    Elm. Sweet! And if Richard isn't worried, neither am I.
* Common Reasons, blockers for adoption -
  * Mobile, quicker assets, things needed for certain size of business. There is
    always a list of needs. Expanding core features. Elm meetup 15 peeps. 2
    years later 350 peeps at conference. Why is Elm not bigger? Whose using Elm
    in production, and now it's dramatically improved. Comparison to like JS,
    meh. I like the Ruby comparison. Current industery is favoriable to Elm.
    What are the direct benefits. Not Specs, benefits! Value of helping other in
    the community, meetups, help out. Creating local markets.
* Best way for beginners to help out -
  * Run a user group, or conference. Talk to peeps. Open a dialog to the owner
    or contribuitor. Beginner centric focus on the Elm community. I like
    Murphy's phrase, 'Thought Share'
* Accessability -
  * Merged into elm-htlm? maybe not so much, big api change. Back to not rushing
    Elm into lib
* WebAPI in Elm -
  * Roadmap Elm, asset management first. Then move onto webapi's. Expanding with
    limits. Community contributions was pretty costly. Evan calling it Kernel
    code. Ports as an escape hatch. I like that Evan calls Elm a platform.
* What makes Elm nice -
  * Lots to choose from, and doesn't really fit together. Project boilerplate,
    ugh. JS had no best practices, need happy developers, keep maintance easy.
    Emotional effect of Elm is incredible. Murphy, a cohesive story. Missing
    piece of 'more' developed eco-systems. 'popular' yes, but not cohesive or
    safe. Co-worker disagreements are lower, tribalism. Removing, or bike
    shedding, a lack of frustrations. Arguments that developers don't make to
    the decision makers. What are the business advantages? Hiring for Elm. Frame
    the conversation.
* Also the carpet at Elm Conf is amazing!
